This is my javascript maze generator and solver. It uses recursive backtracking to generate the maze and breadth first search to solve it, I also added a navigation mesh / pathfinding graph.

There is a bug where sometimes the full path is recoloured except one cell might be missing, I can not be asked to fix it since it doesn't break anything and this took a lot longer than it probably should have to finish anyway.
